- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

When I made structure for card using divs, it was the most rewarding part of the project how the layout was getting structured 

```html
<div class="qr-component-card">
    <img id="qr-code" src="images/image-qr-code.png">
    <div class="font">
      <h2 class="outfit-700">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
      <p class="outfit-400">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Shadowing div was lot more chalenging than I thought it would, but some how I made it, its not the picture perfect copy of the design but its close by.
```css
box-shadow: 0px 8px 25px hsl(210, 26%, 82%);
```

### Continued development

I would definitely love to get more comfortable with css, and this qr component project could improve a lot more when it comes to responsive design, making it compatible on both mobile and desktop.
